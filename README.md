# GNNs-on-Biological-data
This is the GitHub repository for the final project of a data mining course. The aim of the project is to compare three different Graph Neural Network (GNN) models - GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE - on the BioGRID dataset.

The project includes a report detailing the methodology, experimental setup, and results of the comparison. The report can be found in the 'report' directory of the repository.

The repository also contains code implementation for the three GNN models, along with the pre-processing of the BioGRID dataset. The code files can be found in the 'code' directory.

Please note that some data files may be missing from the repository. If you encounter any issues with missing data files, please contact the project owner via email. Alternatively, you can download the necessary data files yourself.

For further information or inquiries, please do not hesitate to contact the project owner via email.
