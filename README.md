# **A Comparison between GNNs for node classification of Gene-Disease Graphs**
This is the GitHub repository for the final project of our data mining course. The aim of the project is to compare three different Graph Neural Network (GNN) models - GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE - on the Gene-Disease Graphs.

The repository contains code implementation for the three GNN models, along with the pre-processing of the gene-disease dataset. We conduct experiments of these three models on two diseases, Asthma  and Schizophrenia, respectively.

In `GCN.ipynb`, we implement a Graph Convolutional Network and use it to classify nodes. 

In `GAT.ipynb`, we implement a Graph Attention Network and use it to classify nodes. 

In `GraphSAGE.ipynb`, we improve the sampling method as GraphSAGE. 

Besides, our poster is uploaded and you can see the experimental results in it.
