This is in contrast with the previous graph machine learning methods like Graph Convolutional Networks or DeepWalk which are inherently transductive i.e they can only generate embeddings for the nodes present in the fixed graph during the training.\n","This implies that, if in future the graph evolves and new nodes (unseen during the training) make their way into the graph then we need to retrain the whole graph in order to compute the embeddings for the new node. This limitation makes the transductive approaches inefficient to get applied on the ever evolving graphs (like social networks, protein-protein networks, etc) because of their inability to generalize on unseen nodes. The other main limitation of transductive approaches is that they cannot leverage the node features e.g text attributes, node profile information, node degrees, etc.\n","On the other hand, the GraphSage algorithm exploits both the rich node features and the topological structure of each node’s neighborhood simultaneously to efficiently generate representations for new nodes without retraining."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":17822,"status":"ok","timestamp":1645026401775,"user":{"displayName":"alireza samadi","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gj1rvUsWUWglw4bHdIjOXTa4XhrFtdw1wUpGtsY=s64","userId":"15397229150758724266"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"-XkOoay0egzX","outputId":"c2fa070c-4da6-4730-c8d3-cd1fe73c769e"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/home/ubuntu/workspace/GNNs-on-Biological-data/DATA\n"]}],"source":["%cd DATA"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"xN9GY54lQeDR"},"outputs":[],"source":["import torch\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","from torch_geometric.data import NeighborSampler\n","from torch_geometric.nn import SAGEConv\n","import os.path as osp\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import collections\n","from pandas.core.common import flatten\n","import random\n","import time\n","\n","from pandas.core.common import flatten\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","sns.set(rc={'figure.figsize':(16.7,8.27)})\n","sns.set_theme(style=\"ticks\")\n","import collections\n","from scipy.special import softmax\n","import umap\n","\n","from torch_geometric.data import InMemoryDataset\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","import torch_geometric.transforms as T\n","import networkx as nx\n","import torch\n","from torch_geometric.data import Data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"fMS9QXiA2WS3"},"outputs":[],"source":["def attribute_counter(G):\n","  zeros=0\n","  ones=0\n","  for node in tqdm(list(G.nodes())):\n","    if G.nodes[node]['label']==0:\n","      zeros+=1\n","    else:\n","      ones+=1\n","  print(\"#zeros: \", zeros)\n","  print(\"#ones: \", ones)\n","  print(\"portion of ones \" ,ones/(ones+zeros) )"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["disease_name = \"Schizophrenia\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":454,"status":"ok","timestamp":1645026764343,"user":{"displayName":"alireza samadi","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gj1rvUsWUWglw4bHdIjOXTa4XhrFtdw1wUpGtsY=s64","userId":"15397229150758724266"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"mYpfO1F22uOj","outputId":"befd0cd4-3bc1-4ec3-eb65-41ec12a3d799"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/tmp/ipykernel_1232881/1036438151.py:2: DeprecationWarning: info is deprecated and will be removed in version 3.0.\n","\n","  print(nx.info(balanced_G))\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Graph with 1329 nodes and 7900 edges\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["100%|██████████| 1329/1329 [00:00<00:00, 3006596.56it/s]"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["#zeros:  314\n","#ones:  1015\n","portion of ones  0.763732129420617\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["\n"]}],"source":["balanced_G = nx.read_gpickle(f\"{disease_name}_balanced_more.gpickle\")\n","print(nx.info(balanced_G))\n","attribute_counter(balanced_G)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"id":"eIQoc1_Z2xrj"},"outputs":[],"source":["G=balanced_G"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"id":"Bac4WvtyQ794"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/tmp/ipykernel_1232881/2791777853.py:5: DeprecationWarning: \n","\n","The scipy.sparse array containers will be used instead of matrices\n","in Networkx 3.0.
